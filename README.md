# Analysis of the South American Low Level Jet in La Plata Basin and its Response to Climate Change

This project investigates the response to climate change of the South American Low Level Jet. This LLJ is carries moisture to La Plata Basin and is an important factor in the regions rainfall patterns. I am working under Dr Yi Ming at Boston College with Berenize Garcia Nueva and Ilan Valencius as advisors.

The scripts used for the project including testing notebooks, python files, and slurm batch scripts are in the scripts folder. Figures and results are in the figures folder. The data folder houses data used in the project that was small enough for this repo — mainly metadata and blank grids used for mapping.
