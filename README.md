# Analysis of the South American Low Level Jet in La Plata Basin and its Response to Climate Change

This project investigates the response to climate change of the South American low level jet partially responsible for carrying moisture to La Plata Basin. Working with Dr Yi Ming at Boston College's Schiller Institute with Berenize Garcia Nueva and Ilan Valencius.

The scripts used for the project including testing notebooks, python files, and slurm batch scripts are in the scripts folder. Figures and results are in the figures folder. The data folder houses data used in the project that was small enough for this repo — mainly metadata and blank grids used for mapping.
